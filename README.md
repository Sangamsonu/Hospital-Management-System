Introduction:
Hospital Management System (HMS) is a computerized information system that manages all the activities involved in the smooth operation of a hospital. The system aims to improve the quality of healthcare services by streamlining the hospital's administrative and clinical tasks. This project aims to develop a Hospital Management System using C language.

Objectives:
The objectives of the project are as follows:
•	To create a centralized system to manage all hospital activities such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record keeping, etc.
•	To provide a platform for doctors, nurses, and administrative staff to access patient information quickly and easily.
•	To reduce paperwork and improve the efficiency of hospital operations.
•	To enhance patient care by providing doctors with accurate and up-to-date patient information.
•	To improve communication between hospital staff and patients.

Methodology:
The project will be developed using the C programming language. The system will be divided into several modules, each responsible for specific tasks. The modules are:
Patient registration module: This module will be responsible for registering new patients and assigning unique patient IDs. It will also capture patient demographics such as name, address, contact details, and medical history.
Medical record keeping module: This module will capture patient medical history, test results, and medication information. It will also allow doctors to update patient records in real-time.
Reporting module: This module will generate reports on hospital activities such as patient admissions, appointments, and billing.

Results:
The Hospital Management System developed using C language will provide an efficient platform for managing hospital activities. It will reduce paperwork, improve communication between hospital staff and patients, and enhance patient care. The system will be user-friendly and will allow hospital staff to access patient information quickly and easily. The reporting module will generate reports that will enable hospital management to make informed decisions.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Hospital Management System developed using C language will revolutionize the way hospitals operate. It will reduce administrative tasks, improve patient care, and provide hospital management with accurate data for decision-making. The system will be scalable and adaptable to meet the changing needs of hospitals.
